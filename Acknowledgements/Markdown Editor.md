# Markdown Editor

The Markdown Editor uses a number of great pieces of software to render the Markdown stylistically.

* ***MarkedJS.*** MarkedJS renders markdown content as HTML.
* ***Markdown.*** Markdown itself is a dependency of MarkedJS.
* ***Brewdown.*** The 5e stylesheet is a modified version of the one provided by Brewdown.
