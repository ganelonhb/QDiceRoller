Q.D.M.S. is made possible thanks to a number of amazing pieces of Open Source software.

Special thanks is given to the creators of the following software libraries. You can learn more about each library and view their licenses by clicking on an entry in the list view.

* assimp (Modified BSD)
* cpptoml (MIT)
* ExprTk (MIT)
* htmlparser (MIT)

If it weren't for these pieces of software, some of the very cool stuff you can do with Q.D.M.S. would be trickled down at a much slower rate.
